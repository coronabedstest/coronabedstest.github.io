      </strong>
      <p>
At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for this system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you may need to download the updates if you would want to keep using the app. We do not promise that we will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. We may also wish to stop providing the Service, and may terminate use of the app at any time without giving prior notice of termination to you.
